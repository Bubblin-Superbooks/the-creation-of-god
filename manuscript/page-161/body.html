<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Does it not seem strange that the only animal mentioned in the fifth and sixth days’ performance is the whale? “Great whales,” it says. Why great whales? They had heard something about the whale, he therefore received prominence, and was mentioned. They had no knowledge of other animals. Or was this great whale purposely inserted to do that extraordinary service to Jonah?</p><p>And after all this work was done, God saw that it was good. Evidently pleased with his handiwork.</p><p>On the <em>sixth day</em> he finishes his work—he “brings forth living creatures.” Why living creatures? Are not fish, fowl, and whales living creatures? Next come cattle and creeping things. After he created the creeping things he made man.</p><p>Verse 27: “So God created man in his own image; in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them.”</p></div> </div>
