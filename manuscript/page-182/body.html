<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Chapter IV.</h4><h3>Relates To The Crime Of Murder. God Instigates The Crime. Abel Kept Sheep. Cain Tilled The Ground. Cain Brought Vegetables To God, And Abel Brought The Firstlings Of His Flock And <Em>fat</em>. God’s Taste Ran In The Meat Line; He Was Somewhat Of An Epicurean. He Respected Abel And His Offering, But Did Not Respect Cain’s. Then God Asks Cain Why He Is Cross, And After Cain Kills His Brother Abel, He, God, Says: Where Is Thy Brother Abel? And God Dispossesses Cain And Drives Him East Of Eden To Arabia. A Very Arbitrary Landlord This God.</h3><h4>Chapter V: The Fourth Chapter Winds Up With Enos The Son Of Seth. Verse 26: “Then Began Men To Call Upon The Name Of The Lord.” Now, Adam Lived 930 Years, Seth 912 Years, And Enos 905 Years. God During This Period Was Wholly Occupied With These People. Murder Is The Only Incident Of Importance During The First Thousand Years. God Takes A Long Rest For Nearly 2,000 Years Before Anything Of Importance Occurs.</h4></div> </div>
