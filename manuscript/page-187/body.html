I Beg To Remind The Reader We Are Still In Chaldea, Near The Gulf Of Persia; Near The River Euphrates; Near The Garden Of Eden, Where God Created Man; Where We Found Gold And Precious Stones; The Place Where Murder Was Committed; Near Arabia, Etc. The Geographical Location Is Important, And Let The Reader Also Remember That The Whole Tract Of Land Where All These Transactions Are Supposed To Have Taken Place Is Not So Large As Any Moderate-sized State In Our Union.</h4></div> </div>
