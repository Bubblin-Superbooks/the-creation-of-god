<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Verse 2: “The sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair; and they took them wives all which they chose.”</p><p>Sons of God! Was God married? If so, to whom? How many wives had he? How many sons and daughters? Where was God’s residence, if he had any? Were his domestic relations pleasant or not? Was his family large or small? Pray give us some information. Our theologians will tell us, “Ah, that has a spiritual meaning.”</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Verse 3: “And the Lord [not God said: My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is <em>flesh</em>.” Who?—God? “Yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty.” This is a crafty statement, because it shows that the average length of life was the same as it is now, with some few exceptions, and as the fabulous age was past, the only way to get out of the difficulty was to give timely notice that extraordinary ages should not occur</p></div> </div>
