He ought to have known that the heart does not think. Its function is to circulate the blood—a truth which was not discovered until 1618 by Harvey, of England.</p><p>Verse 6: “And it repented the Lord that he had made man on earth, and it grieved him at his <em>heart</em>.”</p><p>Ha! God has a <em>heart</em>, and he has <em>flesh</em>, and he has <em>sons</em>; he knows what is <em>good</em>, <em>evil</em>, <em>wickedness</em>; <em>repents</em> and <em>grieves</em>; and has domestic relations with—evidently ladies, by whom he has children.</p><p>We will not mind the preparations of the ark, or the shipbuilding instructions given by God. A God that knew something of mechanics, shipbuilding, dimensions, measurement, etc.—no wonder theologians call God a designer, an architect. He showed some skill in the construction of this boat.</p></div> </div>
