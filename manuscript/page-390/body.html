He Talks In A Confused, Mystified Fashion, Alluding Now To This People, Now To That; At One Time To The Tribes And At Another To The Moabites, Assyrians, Then To Egypt Or Zion; Dreams Of Tyrants, Hypocrites, And His Hopes Revived About The Remnants Of Israel. When He Speaks Of The Child He Has Not The Remotest Dream Of Christ. He Has No Foreknowledge, Except What His Judgment Suggests. He Feels Annoyed And Irritated, Then His Hope And Aspiration Soothe And Comfort Him, And In Chapter XI He Describes A Most Happy State Of Affairs: “The Wolf Also Shall Dwell With The Lamb, And The Leopard Shall Lie Down With The Kid, And The Calf And The Young Lion And The Fatling Together, And A Little Child Shall Lead Them” (Verse 6). “And The Cow And The Bear Shall Feed; Their Young Ones Shall Lie Down Together, And The Lion Shall Eat Straw Like An Ox” (Xi, 7), Etc.</h4></div> </div>
