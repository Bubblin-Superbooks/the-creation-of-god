<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Chapter Xlix: “Listen, O Isles, Unto Me; And Hearken Ye People From Afar; The Lord Hath Called Me From The Womb; From The Bowels Of My Mother Hath He Made Mention Of My Name.” This Is Supposed To Mean, Christ Being Sent To The Jews Complaineth Of Them.</h4><h4>Chapter Lv: “Thus Saith The Lord, Where Is The Bill Of Your Mother’s Divorcement, Whom I Have Put Away? Or Which Creditors Is It To Whom I Have Sold You? Behold! For Your Iniquities You Have Sold Yourselves, And For Your Transgression Is Your Mother Put Away.” It Is Said That This Means, Christ Sheweth That The Dereliction Of The Jews Is Not To Be Imputed To Him, By His Ability To Save. This Is The Christian Interpretation Of The Above Passage. It Is A Misrepresentation Of Facts As Well As Meaning. Why Twist, Torture, And Falsify It?</h4></div> </div>
