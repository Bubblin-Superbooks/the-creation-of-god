<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p><em>Luke</em> begins historically and then tells his virgin story (i, 27).</p><p><em>John</em> philosophizes, and tells us that (verse 18) “no man hath seen God; the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father, he hath declared him.” In verse 45 he is called the son of Joseph.</p><p>The entrance of Christ into this world is the most stupid and ridiculous piece of nonsense that was ever written. If Christ is the son of God he can be no relation of David, and Joseph can certainly not be his father. Or if the Holy Ghost was the cause of Mary’s condition before marriage, Joseph condoned the offense by living with her, and is the father by adoption and not by nature; and can by no means be a relation or descendant of David.</p><p>Then again, if Joseph is the father, Jesus is not the son of God. In that case, he might be a relation of David, but no relation to God.</p></div> </div>
