And it seems a loss of time and trouble to indicate the character which separates these two from each other. It is not the same when we descend the scale of organisms. Then we arrive at an inferior region where the distinction disappears gradually, and we soon conceive the existence of a frontier zone between the animal and vegetable, a neutral territory which has been designated the kingdom of Protista.</p></div> </div>
