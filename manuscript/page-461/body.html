The permanent fabric of plants is composed of only <em>Carbon</em>, <em>Hydrogen</em>, and <em>Oxygen</em>. The tissue of animals contains an additional element, viz., <em>Nitrogen</em>.

Animals in respiration continually recompose carbonic acid, at the expense of the oxygen of the atmosphere and the carbon of plants.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
