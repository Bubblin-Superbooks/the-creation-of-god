<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">fasciculi are again embedded in and united together by a quantity of connective tissue, forming the <em>perimysium</em>; and the whole is usually inclosed in an external sheath of the same material. Many of the muscles are connected at their more or less tapering extremities with tendons by which they are attached to the bones or hard parts; and the tendinous bands frequently run to a considerable length either on the surface of the muscle or between its fibers.</p><p>There are two chief kinds of muscular tissue, the <em>striped</em>, and the plain or <em>unstriped</em>, and they are distinguished by structural peculiarities and mode of action. The striped form of muscular fibers is sometimes called <em>voluntary</em> muscle, because all muscles under the control of the will are constructed of it. The plain or unstriped variety is often termed <em>involuntary</em>, because it alone is found in the greater number of muscles over which the will has no power.</p></div> </div>
