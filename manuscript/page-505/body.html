It consists of tubular fibers varying in size in various parts, but in general still smaller than those in the cord, their average diameter being 1⁄10000​ of an inch. The fibers of white substance present no division. They are arranged in bundles, separated by a network of delicate connective tissue, consisting of cells, etc. The cells are of various forms and sizes—spheroidal, angular, fusiform, etc. The fibers radiate from the white center of each convolution in all directions into the gray cortex, having a course for the most part perpendicular to the free surface. In passing through the gray substance they are arranged in bundles about 1⁄1500​ of an inch in diameter, thus separating some of the nerve</p></div> </div>
