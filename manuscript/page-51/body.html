<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Oxygen is necessary to combustion, to the respiration of animals, and to various other natural operations, by all of which that gas is withdrawn from the air. It is obvious that its quantity would gradually diminish, unless the tendency of these causes were counteracted by some compensating process. This, to some considerable extent, is accomplished by vegetation, as it is found that healthy plants, under the influence of the sun’s light, constantly draw carbonic acid from the air, the carbon of which is retained, while the oxygen is returned.</p><p>The atmosphere becomes less and less dense from the surface of the earth upwards.</p><p>Animals and vegetables exist in this atmosphere. They cannot exist in any other. All living things and beings live on this earth’s crust. Vegetables are fixed to the soil of this earth, while animals move freely upon it.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "><em>The earth’s crust._—Sir Charles Lyell speaking of this</em></p></div> </div>
