<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">external fibrous membrane, named <em>dura mater</em>, which closely lines the interior of the skull, and forms a loose sheath in the spinal canal; 2. An internal areolo-vascular tunic, the <em>pia mater</em>, which accurately covers the brain and spinal cord; and, 3. An intermediate membrane, the <em>arachnoid</em>, which lies over the pia mater, the two being in some places in close connection, and in others separated by a considerable space.</p><p>The <em>sympathetic nerves</em> are distributed in general to all the internal viscera, and to the coats of the blood-vessels. Some organs, however, receive their nerves also from the cerebro-spinal system, as the lungs, the heart, and the upper and lower parts of the alimentary canal.</p><p>The great gangliated cords consist of two series, in each of which the ganglia are connected by intervening cords. These cords are placed symmetrically in front of the vertebral column and extend from the base of the skull to the coccyx.</p></div> </div>
