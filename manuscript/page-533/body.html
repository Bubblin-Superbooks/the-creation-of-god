Bread, for example, contains 30 per cent of carbon and 1 per cent of nitrogen. If bread alone, therefore, were taken as food, a man would require in order to obtain the requisite nitrogen 30,000 grains, containing of carbon, 9,000 grains; of nitrogen, 300 grainsâ€”an excess of carbon above the amount required of 4,500 grains.</p></div> </div>
