The orifice of the larynx is guarded by muscles, and can be opened or closed at will.</p><p>Each lung is partially subdivided into separate portions called <em>lobes</em>. The right lung has three lobes, and the left lung has two. Each of these lobes, again, is composed of a large number of minute parts, called lobules. Each pulmonary lobule may be considered a lung in miniature, consisting as it does of a branch of a bronchial tube, air-cells, blood-vessels, nerves, and lymphatics, with a sparing amount of areolar tissue.</p><p>The terminal portion of each lobule is composed of a group of pouches or air-cells, which communicate with the intercellular air passages. These cells are of various forms, according to the mutual pressure to which they are subject. Their cell walls are nearly in contact, and they vary from 1⁄50​ to 1⁄90​ of an inch in diameter.</p></div> </div>
