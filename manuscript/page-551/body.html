The oxygen present is insufficient to the whole of the <em>h�moglobin of the red corpuscles</em>; much reduced h�moglobin is present, hence the purple color of venous blood. As the blood-vessels pass through the capillaries of the lungs, this reduced h�moglobin takes from the pulmonary air its complement of oxygen, all or nearly all the h�moglobin of the red corpuscles becomes oxy-h�moglobin, and the purple color forthwith shifts into scarlet. The h�moglobin of arterial blood is saturated or nearly saturated with oxygen. Passing from the left ventricle to the capillaries, some of the oxy-h�moglobin gives up its oxygen to the tissues, becomes reduced h�moglobin, and the blood in consequence becomes once more venous, with a purple hue. <em>Thus the</em></p></div> </div>
