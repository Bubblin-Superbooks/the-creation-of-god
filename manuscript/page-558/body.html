The sudoriferous glands are abundantly distributed over the whole surface of the body; but are especially numerous, as well as very large, in the skin of the palm of the hand. They are estimated from 2,738 to 3,528 in each superficial square inch. They are almost equally abundant and large in the skin of the sole. The glands by which the peculiar odorous matter of the axilla is secreted form a nearly complete layer under the cutis, and are like the ordinary sudoriferous glands, except in being larger and having very short ducts. In the neck and back, where they are least numerous, the glands amount to 417 on the square inch. The total number is estimated, at 2,381,248; and supposing the orifice of each gland to present a surface of 1⁄54​ of a line in diameter (and regarding a line as equal to 1⁄10​ of an inch) the whole of the glands would present an evaporating surface of about eight square inches.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "><em>Sebaceous glands</em> secrete a peculiar fatty matter.
