The secretion takes place by the agency of the gland cells, and equally in all the parts of the urine tubes. The protoplasmic cells which line at least a large portion of the tubuli urineferi elaborate from the blood certain substances, and discharge them into the channels of the tubules. All parts of the tubular system of the kidney take part in the secretion of urine as a whole, but there is another provision of vessels for a more simple draining off of the water from the blood when required.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The large size of the renal arteries and veins permits so rapid a transit of the blood through the kidneys <em>that the whole of the blood is purified by them</em>.
