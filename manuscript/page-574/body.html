<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p><em>The sources and distribution of heat.</em> Wherever metabolism of protoplasm is going on, heat is being generated. All over the body heat is being set free; more abundantly in the more active tissues, and most of all in those tissues the metabolism of which leads to little or no external work. The metabolism of the tissues (including the blood) and of the food within the alimentary canal is the source of the heat of the body. But heat, being continually produced, is as continually being lost, as we have seen, by the skin, urine, and feces. The blood passing from one part of the body to another, and carrying warmth from the tissues where heat is being actively generated, to the tissues or organs where heat is being lost by conduction or evaporation, tends to equalize the temperature of the various parts and thus maintain a constant bodily temperature.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Taking the body as a whole, under normal conditions, the chief sources of the production of heat</p></div> </div>
