The brain, too, may be regarded as a source of heat, since its temperature is higher than that of the arterial blood with which it is supplied.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Heat is lost by the skin, respiration, feces, etc. The great regulator, however, is undoubtedly the skin. The more blood passes through the skin the greater will be the loss of heat by conduction, radiation, and evaporation. The working of this heat-regulating mechanism is well seen in the case of exercise. Since every muscular contraction gives rise to heat, exercise must increase for the time being the production of heat; yet the bodily temperature rarely rises as much as a</p></div> </div>
