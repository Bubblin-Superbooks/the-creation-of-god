By diffusion the new or <em>tidal</em> air, as it is frequently called, gives up the <em>oxygen</em> to, and takes carbonic acid from, the old or <em>stationary</em> air, and thus when it leaves the chest in expiration has been the means both of introducing oxygen into and of removing carbonic acid from it. By this ebb and flow of the tidal air and the diffusion between it and the stationary air, the air in the lungs is being continually renewed, through the alternate expansion and contraction of the chest. In what may be considered normal breathing, the respiratory act is repeated about seventeen times a minute; and the duration of the inspiration as compared with that of the expiration and such pause as exists, is about as ten to twelve.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">When the ordinary respiratory movements prove insufficient to effect the necessary changes in the blood,</p></div> </div>
