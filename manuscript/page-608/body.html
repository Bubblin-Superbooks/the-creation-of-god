Cell multiplication by division, cell growth, cell modification, exist in plants. Fluids are <em>transferred</em> from cell to cell by a process called <em>endosmose</em>. <em>Absorption</em> takes place by the roots, and the substance absorbed is carried up into the leaves, even to the topmost bough of a tree, passing in its course many millions of apparently water-tight partitions. Plants exchange gases, taking in carbonic acid and giving off oxygen. They evolve heat, have organs of reproduction, and elaborate the material for the final evolution of the seed. This seed, whether of grain, of vegetables, or of fruits, is composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. And these constitute the starches and sugars which we find have been evolved by the vegetable or plant, and which form the food for animals.
