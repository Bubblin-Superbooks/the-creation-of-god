Gastric juice thus readily dissolves coagulated proteids which otherwise are insoluble, or soluble only with difficulty in very strong acids.</p><p>Certain conditions are required for the perfection of the process, which are all found in the stomach. The first is a temperature of 100ï¿½ F. Second, minute division and constant movement favor digestion. Third, the greater the surface presented to the action of the juice, the more rapid the solution.</p><p>Neutralization of the juice wholly arrests digestion.</p><p>The digestive action of gastric juice on proteids, like that of saliva on starch, is a ferment action; in other words, the solvent action of gastric juice is essentially due to the presence in it of a ferment body called pepsin.</p></div> </div>
