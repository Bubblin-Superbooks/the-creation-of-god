It is usually about five to six feet in length, being about one-fifth of the whole length of the intestinal canal. The large intestine is constructed of four coats like those of the stomach and small intestines, namely, the serous, the muscular, the areolar or submucous, and the mucous. It is divided into the ascending colon, transverse and descending colon, and rectum and anus.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The <em>c�cum</em> is a short wide pouch, communicating with the lower end of the small intestines through an opening guarded by the ileo-c�cal valve. The appendix vermiformis is attached to the c�cum. The colon commences at the right groin, ascends to the liver, forms the hepatic flexure, then crosses transversely from right to left to the spleen, forms the splenic flexure,</p></div> </div>
