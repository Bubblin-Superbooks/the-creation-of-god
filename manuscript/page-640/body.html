(2) On proteids (meats) it also exercises a solvent action, so far similar to that of gastric juice that by it the proteids are converted into peptones. (3) On fats pancreatic juice has a twofold action: it emulsifies them, and it splits up neutral fats into their respective acids and glycerine.</p><p>Thus pancreatic juice is remarkable for the power it possesses of acting on all food-stuffsâ€”on starch, fats, and proteids.</p><p><em>Succus entericus</em> (intestinal juice). The precise action of this is not known. It has been said to act upon starch, to convert proteids into peptones, and to emulsify fats. On the other hand, each of these actions has been denied.</p></div> </div>
