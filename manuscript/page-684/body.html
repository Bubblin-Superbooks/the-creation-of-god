For example, the atmosphere, the balance of power between O and N, is essential to both plant and animal. So with water, O H2. And so with those foods, starch and sugars, C18H30O15 or C6 H12O6; in each of these substances Carbon has its complement of Hydrogen and Oxygen. That is, the Carbon is, as it were, diluted in a sufficient quantity of water to make it suitable for food. Rob it of its Oxygen and it becomes a poison, an active poison.
