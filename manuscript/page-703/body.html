<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The theories on alcohol are various. I quote some of the more important ones, briefly stated:</p><p>Liebig thought that alcohol disappeared by complete and rapid combustion.</p><p>Lallemand and Perrin entertained the theory that alcohol was eliminated by the excretory organs. (That means, perhaps, that alcohol simply promenaded through the system.)</p><p>Parks was of opinion that alcohol is directly absorbed by the blood-vessels without undergoing any change or decomposition.</p><p>Another theory was that alcohol is converted into acetic acid (C2 H O2); and that acetic acid is split up into carbonic acid (C O2) and waterâ€”which is impossible, as there is not Oxygen enough for both C O2 and H2 O.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">It appears, then, that alcohol does not disappear by rapid combustion, except when taken in very small</p></div> </div>
