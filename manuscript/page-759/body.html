<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">possession, might asserts its right, and the conquerer becomes the ruling power.</p><p>In the early stages of human civilization, thousands of years ago, the simplest primitive rules were established for the conduct and guidance of the individual living in the community—for, of course, mutual protection and self-preservation. Humanity in a barbarous state adopted these rules, and handed them down from generation to generation until at length they were codified into laws. What are they?</p><p>Honor thy parents.</p><p>Do not commit murder.</p><p>Do not take another man’s wife.</p><p>Do not bear false witness.</p><p>Do not take anything belonging to another.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">These are laws for self-preservation and mutual protection! If such simple rules were not recognized and established, neither life nor property would be safe.</p></div> </div>
