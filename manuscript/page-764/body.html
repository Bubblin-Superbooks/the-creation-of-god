Activity and diligence produce and invent all things.</p><p>All wrongful acts committed are either injuries done to ourselves, or injuries inflicted upon others.</p><p>Injuries done to ourselves are not necessarily sins. Onanism, for example, is unquestionably injurious, yet is not recognized as a sin. It leads to the insane asylum, and in many instances underlies religious insanity.</p><p>There are other disgusting practices that are neither injurious nor recognized as sins.</p><p>The stomach commits no sin, but leads nevertheless to many wrongs, to oneâ€™s self.</p><p>All crimes are sins, but all sins are not crimes. And all injuries done to others are accounted both sins and crimes.</p><p>What seems very strange yet is wonderfully true is that all sins and crimes against others find their origin in the indulgence of either stomach or sexual organs.</p></div> </div>
