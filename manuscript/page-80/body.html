The Indians divide this time into four principal periods: First period, that of innocence or simplicity, 1,728,000 years; second period, 276,000; the third period, 864,000; and the ages of misfortune about 422,000—Cali-yon-gan period. Similar statements are made by Cicero (“De Divinat,” I, 19), concerning the Chaldeans: “Condemnemus, inquam, hos aut stultiti� aut vanitatis aut imprudenti� qui 470 millia annorum ut ipsi dicunt monumentis comprehensa continent.”</p></div> </div>
