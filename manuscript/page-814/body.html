What a pity that Daniel’s <em>Mene, mene, Tekel upharsin</em> is not quite applicable to the present condition of Christianity. The great ecclesiastical bugbear of Christianity, backed by their God, their Son, Holy Ghost, Virgin Mary, saints, popes, Heaven and Hell, and their infinite methods of salvation, is nothing near so terrible as he used to be. That bugbear has been tamed, and is, comparatively speaking, gentle. His appetites and his passions have been subdued. Indeed Paul deserves no small credit for polishing the Mosaic God. It is only occasionally that Paul mentions his God’s wrath or severity, and very mildly too. Paul’s God comes near being esthetic. The Mosaic God is muscular and energetic. Paul’s God is mild and persuasive. The Mosaic God was a fighting god, conquering territory and molding a political nation. Paul’s God has quite another line of business, sin-forgiving and soul-saving. The Mosaic God was all alone engaged in business.</p></div> </div>
