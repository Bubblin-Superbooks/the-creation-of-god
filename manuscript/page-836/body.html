Shake off the dust of superstition and ignorance if you would be free.</p><p>It is the noblest work of man to make himself free—to make himself equal, not muscular—free from prejudice, free from superstitions, free from bigotry, free from ignorance, free from vice, free from passions, free from wrong-doing either to yourself or to your fellow-man. Equal you can be in brain power, brain culture, in brain force, by brain culture, education, in the improvement and perfection of the intellectual faculties, so that we may exercise our understanding and judgment, free and untrammeled, to the benefit of ourselves and to the benefit of our neighbors.</p><p>The perfection you imagine your God ought to be, exalt yourself to that perfection, and be an intelligent free man.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
