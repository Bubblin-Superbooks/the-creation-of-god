There is no reason that the elements should not enter into organic life of a similar, perhaps either inferior or superior, organization to that existing on this world? What is to hinder them? It is certainly possible, therefore probable. May we not assume that it is both possible and probable? Those on earth who believe that this globe of ours was especially fitted up for us, made for man only, are very presumptuous. There was no special forethought for the adaptation or convenience of creatures like ourselves.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">As to the forethought, adaptation, or convenience, the hog, the elephant, the ass, and the fly enjoy their life</p></div> </div>
