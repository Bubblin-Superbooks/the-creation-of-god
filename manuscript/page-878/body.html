It is a fact, a well-established fact, that different substances require varying degrees of temperature to reduce them to a liquid, gaseous, or solid condition, and no matter where the temperature is produced the result will be the same. If, for example, a temperature can be procured on the surface of Uranus, or Saturn, sufficient to melt iron, lead, or silver, these metallic substances will melt at Uranus or Saturn as quickly as on the earth’s surface. The laws regulating radiation, absorption, dispersion, or contraction, or any other phase the elementary substances may assume, under heat or pressure, etc.—these laws will hold good on any of the planets just as well as on this terrestrial planet.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">It is therefore far from unreasonable to presume that the organizable elements may have assumed a vitality on</p></div> </div>
