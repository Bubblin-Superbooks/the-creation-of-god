Because it is perfectly natural for these substances to organize themselves into life, under a certain degree of temperature, moisture, and electricity, when these necessary elements are present—as natural as that oxygen and hydrogen make water, or that the sun’s heat sets all the elementary substances into a state of activity.</p><p>We have no reason to doubt that these planets, or even the sun, have not their own vital products just as well as this earth. These vital products may be of low grade, or of a very highly organized nature. We may assume, without fear of any great error, that wherever there are air and water there is life. Because if there is heat it is a sun’s heat, otherwise there could not be air and water. If there is a sun’s heat, atmosphere, and water, there is certainly life, lowly or highly developed.</p></div> </div>
