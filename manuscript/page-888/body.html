<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">God in man, pure and elect,
Let common sense and reason wake!
Knowledge, truth, makes man perfect.
Go search your God through depths of space
On suns and stars infinite. 
The mind expands to every place.
To distance without limit.
If you don’t find the God you seek
Search within yourselves. Perchance,
You’ll find your God, quite good and meek,
But not in your ignorance.</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
