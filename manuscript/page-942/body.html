Do not slander others, lest you do an injury, doing evil without benefit to yourself. A slanderer is despised. Let your motives be pure, your purpose upright. Be mild in speech, even in temper. Kind words are inexpensive. Anger and passion are brutal qualities, be human. Do not get excited over trifles, it does not prolong life. If your habits are bad, mend them. Good impulses come from good feelings, as bad impulses from bad feelings. Our character is molded by our habits, as our habits are by our instruction. By your conduct gain the esteem of your fellow-men. It is better to be loved than hated. Injure no one. Despise no one. Be neither prejudiced nor bigoted. Gain the respect of every man, and respect those that deserve to be respected. Obey the existing laws. Learn to depend on yourself. Trust in your own judgment, none will be so true to you as yourself. Hope is delusive, action is certain. Reveal not your own</p></div> </div>
