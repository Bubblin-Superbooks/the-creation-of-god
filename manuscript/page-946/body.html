The friction of life is great; the less the resisting force, the sooner it yields. In the struggle the strongest survive. Tenacity to life and tenacity to our possessions lead to success. Let those who accumulate great wealth unjustly, yield it readily to those who are most in need. A man can accumulate vast riches only by the industry of many, never by his own.

Be your own God, your own Savior, your own priest.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
