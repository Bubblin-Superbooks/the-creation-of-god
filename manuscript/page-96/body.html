It is the lightest gas known, being 14.47 times lighter than air. It combines with oxygen to form water.</p><p>Nitrogen is a colorless, tasteless, inodorous gas, slightly lighter than air. It does not combine readily with bodies, and it is a very inert substance, neither supporting combustion or animal life, nor burning itself. It has, however, no poisonous qualities, and animals plunged into a jar of this gas die simply of suffocation from want of oxygen. Nitrogen exists in a free state in the air, of which it constitutes four-fifths by bulk. It occurs combined in the bodies of plants and animals, and in various chemical compounds, such as nitre, whence the gas derives its name.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Carbon is a solid element; it is not known in the free state, either as a liquid or as a gas.
